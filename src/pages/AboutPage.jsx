          <p>
            Hello! I’m Aditya Jain, a passionate Front-End Developer with a
            good foundation in creating responsive and user-friendly web
            applications. I leverage my expertise in JavaScript and React to
            build engaging and efficient user interfaces.. I am pursuing a
            degree in Computer Science, where I am developing a keen interest in
            software development and problem-solving. Over the past few years, I
            have honed my skills through various projects, including specific
            projects you've worked on, e.g., a movie review website or other
            applications, where I utilized my technical skills to create
            efficient and engaging solutions. I have experience working with a
            range of technologies, including HTMl and CSS, which
            allows me to develop comprehensive applications from concept to
            deployment. I am committed to creating seamless user experiences. In
            addition to my technical skills, I believe in continuous learning
            and personal development. I actively engage in coding challenges and stay
            updated with the latest trends in technology. Outside of coding, I
            enjoy exploring new technologies. I’m always eager to connect with like-minded
            professionals and collaborate on innovative projects.
            <p>
            While my primary expertise is in front-end development, I am also
            keen to learn back-end technologies to expand my skill set and
            become a more versatile developer.

          <p>
            I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering
            from IIT Dhanbad. Initially, I began my academic journey in the
            Mathematics and Computing branch but successfully transitioned to
            the Computer Science and Engineering branch to align more closely
            with my passion for software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            My academic experience has not only strengthened my understanding of
            core computer science principles but also helped me develop strong
            skills in C++ and competitive programming. I actively participate in
            coding competitions, which has further enhanced my problem-solving
            abilities and my ability to write efficient code under pressure.
